<h2>Project 2</h2>

Implementing <b>pathfinding AI</b> for PacMan.<br>
-Graph theory <br>
-Djiktsra's algorithm<br> 
-effeciency based on cost cap<br>

We were given a text implementation of Pacman, and we were to implement an AI to predict and simulate moving pacman with a modified Djikstra's algorithm, and implement our heurisitc. I also wrote a report based on relative perfomance, and comparing the results to theory.

The results of the experimentation report can be found <a href="https://github.com/extragravee/COMP20003/blob/master/project2/921322%20-%20Project2%20-%20experimentation%20(2).pdf">here</a>
